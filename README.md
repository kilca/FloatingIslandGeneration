# FloatingIslandGeneration
It's a personnal project about procedural floating island generation based on Sebastian Lague youtube tutorial.

The main goal is to create a working procedural floating island.

Some script was made by Sebastian Lague and used for this project, all his scripts belong to him.

The algorithms used here are not optimised. This is just a free example for others.

Currently containing :
 - UnderIsland HeightMap generation
 - TopIsland HeightMap generation
 - Mesh generation
 - Mesh extrusion
 - Mesh smooth
 - Many properties (noise, seed etc ...)
 - Height Color Generation
 - Procedural Tree Placement
 - Procedural River
 
This code is free to use, please just mention me and Sebastian Lague if you can.

I plan to continue this project on my free time (see infos.txt for more infos).
